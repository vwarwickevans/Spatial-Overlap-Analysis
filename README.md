# Spatial-Overlap-Analysis
Code and data to run the Spatial Overlap Analysis in Subarea 48.1 on a monthly timestep July 2025.

We provide code, data layers and shapefiles to run the SOA as described in WG-EMM2025/12 including with or without GPZs/SPZs. 

Management units are those endorsed by CCAMLR in 2024.

Desirability is run based on 2013-2018 fishing data.

The winter krill layer has been upscaled to match summer biomass estimates.

In the months fishing does not take place desirability is equal across the MUs.

The z parameter (summer/winter weighting) is set to 0.5.
